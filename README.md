# Calculator

Calculator project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator).

First attempt with using arrays to store user input. Failed!
The second attept with the use of `eval()` function, which takes string and evaluates JS code.

##### Bugs:
- [x] ~~display after clicking "=" can be changed by the user;~~
- [] - display too big in firefox browser

##### Feauture to implement:
- [ ] keyboard support;
